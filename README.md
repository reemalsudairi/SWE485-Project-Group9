# Motivation:
  Navigating Riyadh's extensive real estate market can be overwhelming for buyers and renters due to its vast property options. Our project simplifies this search by using a machine learning model to quickly recommend properties that match user preferences on budget, location, and features. This approach aims to reduce the effort in property searches and enhance user satisfaction by effectively matching them with their ideal properties.
